- **Progressive Effects**: Each submission triggers animated drawing effects that paint themselves over 2-4 seconds with smooth animations
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Instant synchronization across devices using localStorage and BroadcastChannel API
- **No Server Required**: Fully client-side application using browser storage for persistence
- **Premium UI/UX**: Modern glassmorphism design with Inter typography, fluid animations, and immersive backgrounds
