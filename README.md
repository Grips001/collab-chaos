# Collective Canvas

A premium real-time collaborative generative art experience where audience members contribute colors and words that transform into spectacular visual effects on a shared canvas. Features a beautiful modern glassmorphism interface with progressive drawing animations.

## 🎨 Overview

Collective Canvas creates a living, communal artwork where each participant adds their unique mark through simple color and word choices. The system transforms these contributions into 13 different spectacular visual effects that paint themselves progressively onto a shared canvas, creating an emergent collaborative masterpiece.

**Phase Two Complete**: Now featuring a premium glassmorphism UI with Inter typography, fluid animations, and immersive backgrounds that blend seamlessly with the artistic canvas.

**Phase Three Complete**: Enhanced with intelligent effect positioning system that ensures perfect distribution across the entire canvas, preventing clipping and creating more balanced collaborative artworks.

**Phase Four Complete**: Added animated background system with floating dust particles that drift and twinkle like dust in sunlight, creating a living, breathing canvas atmosphere without interfering with the main collaborative effects.
